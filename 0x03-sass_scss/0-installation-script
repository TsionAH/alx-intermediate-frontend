Steps I used to install SASS:

1. Installed nvm (Node Version Manager):
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   Reopened terminal or sourced nvm.

2. Installed Node v20.16 and set it active:
   nvm install 20.16
   nvm use 20.16

3. Installed Dart Sass globally:
   npm install -g sass
